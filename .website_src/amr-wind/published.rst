Additional published cases using AMR-Wind
=========================================

These simulations have been performed for verification and validation of this CFD tool.
Following publication of the methods paper on AMR-Wind, this page provides those cases
to the public, though these are not intended as benchmark cases in the same manner as the
rest of this repository.
