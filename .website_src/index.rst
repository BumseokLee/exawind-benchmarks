====================
 ExaWind Benchmarks
====================

These are reference problems used to evaluate and compare the performance
of ExaWind. These benchmarks have been chosen to represent the various
capabilities within the ExaWind software stack, featuring cases for each
individual solver (AMR-Wind and Nalu-Wind) and the overset hybrid solver.
By providing up-to-date examples in an applied context, they also serve as
a starting point for researchers setting up similar simulations.

This repository is intended to become a nexus for collaborating among
research groups, providing a reference frame for other code capabilities,
and hosting external contributions.
