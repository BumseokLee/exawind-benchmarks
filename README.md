# exawind-benchmarks
These are reference problems used to evaluate and compare the performance of ExaWind. These benchmarks have been chosen to represent the various capabilities within the ExaWind software stack, featuring cases for each individual solver (AMR-Wind and Nalu-Wind) and the overset hybrid solver. By providing up-to-date examples in an applied context, they also serve as a starting point for researchers setting up similar simulations.

Benchmark problems are divided by the ExaWind program used to perform the simulation, whether that is amr-wind alone, nalu-wind alone, or the full overset solver, exawind. For each problem included, the files required to run the case are included in an input_files directory, information about the latest run is contained in a run_info directory, and output data is compiled in a performance directory. Run information primarily includes the headers log files, which are intended to capture the git hash version used to run each specific example, and the footers of log files, which are intended to display profiling and timing data available at the end of the run, as well as explicitly showing how many time steps were taken in the simulation. Performance broadly includes both measured results from the simulation, such as physical quantities of interest, and computational timing information.
