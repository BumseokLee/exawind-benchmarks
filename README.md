# exawind-benchmarks
Benchmark cases for packages within the ExaWind suite, including setup and performance documentation

These are reference problems used to evaluate and compare the performance of ExaWind. These benchmarks have been chosen to represent the various capabilities within the ExaWind software stack, featuring cases for each individual solver (AMR-Wind and Nalu-Wind) and the overset hybrid solver. By providing up-to-date examples in an applied context, they also serve as a starting point for researchers setting up similar simulations.
