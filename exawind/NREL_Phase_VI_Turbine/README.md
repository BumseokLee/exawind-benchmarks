## NREL Phase VI Turbine

ExaWind simulations are performed for NRELâ€™s Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase VI rotor. The experimental conditions are summarized below:

- Tested in the 80 X 120 ft wind tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center (M. H. Hand et al, 2001)
- Two bladed rotor with a diameter of 10.529 m 
- Fixed tip speed, 72 RPM
- Blade section: single airfoil, S809, from r/R=0.25 
- Nonlinear twist with blade tip pitch of 3deg
- Pitch and twist axis at 0.3c
