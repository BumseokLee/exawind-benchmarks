For NACA 0021 airfoil:

The current directory consists of four subdirectories for 
30, 45, 60 and 90 degree angle of attack simulations which run
for 100 iterations.

There is another subdirectory containing files for running the 45 degree case
for 160 flow-through times (8000 iterations) to obtained converged mean lift and drag
quantities. The experimental data from Sheldahl et al. (2003)
for the polars are also provided in the text files.

Each folder consists of a yaml input file and slurm file for
running the case.
