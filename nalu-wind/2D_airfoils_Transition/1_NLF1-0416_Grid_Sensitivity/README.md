# Airfoil verification and validation 1: NASA NLF(1)-0416

A grid sensitivity study was performed for NASA NLF(1)-0416 airfoil using Nalu-Wind with the 1-eq gamma transition model.
Six different mesh resolutions were tested, and the results were compared to those from NASAâ€™s flow solvers, OVERFLOW and FUN3D, using the same turbulence and transition models, CFD meshes, and inflow conditiions.

## Simulation Conditions

- Test airfoil: NASA NLF(1)-0416 airfoil
- Flow Condition: M=0.1, Re=4million, Tu=0.15%, Angle of attack=5deg
- CFD meshes with six different resoltuions provided by [AIAA CFD Transition Modeeling DG](https://transitionmodeling.larc.nasa.gov/)
- Turbulence / Transition model: SST-2003 with 1-eq Gamma transition model, mut/mu=1
- Nalu-Wind version: [6155b17fa6b8914a819a492230c96f7990a97b78](https://github.com/Exawind/nalu-wind/commit/6155b17fa6b8914a819a492230c96f7990a97b78)
