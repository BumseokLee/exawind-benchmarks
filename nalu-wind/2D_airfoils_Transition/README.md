# Validation and Verification of the 1-eq Gamma Transition Model

This repository contains 2-D airfoil ExaWind benchmark cases for the 1-equation Gamma transition model. The cases include:

- NASA NLF(1)-0416 airfoil at M=0.1, Re=4M, Tu=0.15%
- TU Delft DU00-W-212 airfoil at M=0.1, Re=3M, Tu=0.0864%

Each directory provides the Nalu-Wind input files, log files, and a summary of the results.
