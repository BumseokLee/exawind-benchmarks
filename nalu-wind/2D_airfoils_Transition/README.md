# Validation and Verification of the 1-eq Gamma Transition Model

This repository contains ExaWind benchmark cases for the 1-equation Gamma transition model. The cases include:

- NASA NLF(1)-0416 airfoil at M=0.1, Re=4M, Tu=0.15%
- NREL S809 airfoil at M=0.1, Re=2M, Tu=0.07%

Each directory provides the Nalu-Wind input files, log files, and a summary of the results.
