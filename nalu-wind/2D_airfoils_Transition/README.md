# Validation and Verification of the 1-eq Gamma Transition Model

This repository contains ExaWind benchmark cases for the 1-equation Gamma transition model. The cases include:

- Grid sensitivity analysis for the transition model using the NASA NLF(1)-0416 airfoil,
- Angle of attack (AoA) sweep for the NLF(1)-0416 airfoil, and
- AoA sweep for the NREL S809 airfoil.

Each directory provides the Nalu-Wind input files, log files, and a summary of the results.
